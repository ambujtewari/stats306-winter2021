# Please read these instructions carefully

- Exam should be turned in via canvas file uploads by April 28 (canvas will accept submissions until 3 am EDT on April 29).
- Late submissions will **NOT** be accepted (unless there is a documented emergency or other major disruption beyond your control).
- You are allowed to use specific websites listed below, your own course notes, and a running R interpreter.
- _If you use any website(s) not specifically listed as allowed, you MUST list it in your exam._
- Failure to fully disclose resources that you used for the exam can result in loss of points.
- You are **NOT** allowed to copy answers from anyone/anywhere including any online sources! All work must be your own.
- No googling for answers! We reserve the right to run plagiarism detection software and report violations of academic integrity to the Dean's office.
- There are a total of 8 problems. Each problem is worth 5 points. Make sure you look at the entire exam.
- Each problem begins with a brief description of the tibble used in the problem followed by a brief description of all columns. Please read these carefully.
- Make sure you only edit cells explicitly marked as solution cells. In particular, do **NOT** edit cells that say "DO NOT EDIT THIS CELL".
- Like homeworks, upload the **pdf** version of your completed exam before the due date
- However, unlike homeworks, please **ALSO submit the actual notebook** (which has .ipynb extension)
- Make sure these packages are loaded: `tidyverse` and `lubridate`
- To ask questions use the appropriate problem channel in slack (e.g., `#problem1` channel for problem 1). If you ask privately we will post the questions and answer publicly (after removing your name).
