# Problem 7

## Part 1

"Add a new column `new_heights`" should be replaced with "Add a new column `new_height`" (i.e., there should be no trailing "s" in the column's name)

## Part 4

"Create a tibble named height_prob" should be replaced with "Create a tibble named `heights_prob`" (i.e., there should be an "s" after "height" in the name of the tibble)
